Account Creation and Claim Process Overview

You need to create an account and select your role as either a Lecturer, Coordinator, or Manager.

Claim Process:

Pending: Once you submit a claim as a Lecturer, it enters the pending stage.
Verified: The Coordinator verifies the claim.
Approved: The Manager gives final approval to the verified claim.
Rejected: A claim can be rejected by either the Coordinator or the Manager.
As a Lecturer, you can view and track your claims in real-time on the "Track Claims" page.

User Login and Role-Based Access:

When you log in, you are directed to the login page. Depending on your assigned role, you are redirected to a dashboard specific to your role: Lecturer, Coordinator, or Manager.
Lecturer: You can submit claims and view the status of your claims.
Coordinator: You verify claims submitted by Lecturers.
Manager: You provide final approval for claims verified by the Coordinator.
As a Lecturer, you can only track the status of claims you have submitted, not those submitted by other Lecturers.

Logging in as a Lecturer, Coordinator, or Manager will take you to the respective dashboard for your role. If you attempt to access areas not approved for your role, an "Access Denied" page will be shown.
